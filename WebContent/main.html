	 	<p><b>"Experience the elegance of Korean Culture"</b></p>
	 	<p> Meaning "a place where one can enjoy the traditions of times past and rest one's soul," K-Hotel is a Korean traditional culture space with a history of 140 years. It was renovated by Human National Treasure-Master Carpenter Young Jin Chung in 2003 and has since received international acclaim. Here, the harmony created between traditional Korean architecture and nature has created an opportunity for the true beauty of hanok to shine. Upon passing the graceful main gate, one can see neat a cozy hanok. The bamboo and pine trees scattered in the garden add to its natural beauty and the rubber shoes placed on each terrace stone bring back the scent of old memories.
